# **MediX11 – A Multi-Disease Prediction System**  

### **Overview**  
MediX11 is a comprehensive **machine learning and deep learning-driven** health analysis system that predicts **11 critical diseases** with high accuracy. It leverages **data science, web scraping, and AI models** to provide insights into medical conditions, enabling early diagnosis and better treatment planning.  

### **Features**  
✔ **Multi-Disease Prediction** – Covers 11 major diseases, from diabetes to neurological disorders.  
✔ **Deep Learning & ML Models** – Utilizes advanced algorithms for high accuracy.  
✔ **Early Detection & Survival Analysis** – Predicts disease onset and survival rates.  
✔ **Medical Data Scraping** – Extracts real-time research insights from **PubMed**.  
✔ **Image-Based & Clinical Data Models** – Supports diverse medical datasets.  
✔ **Deployed Risk Assessment** – 10-year CHD (Coronary Heart Disease) risk prediction live on **Streamlit Cloud** at [chdvis.streamlit.com](https://chdvis.streamlit.com).
